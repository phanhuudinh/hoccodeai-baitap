When I first stumbled upon Chain of Thought, I almost laughed. It was so simple! Yet, it seemed so effective. At this point I’ve already dove deep into prompting. How could such a simple technique yield so much improvement? I created advanced AI personas. Integrated Ontological maps, unbeknownst to me. Workflows of refinement.
How could such a simple technique be the talk of the month. I was jealous even. Here I was in a dark Discord with a couple of like-minded individuals. Prompting is about effectiveness. I was too practical and too down to earth to dismiss it. From that time I’ve improved so much. Have come to know many great people, my ego is smaller yet always ready to fire.
I am not much of a talker, most of the times I operate from the shadows, as lame as it sounds. This is known by the people that know me. Do not expect a deep and creative well written piece, however do expect a thoughtful series on prompts, what they are and how they are constructed. I will take you into a journey into the mind of some of the greatest prompters the world does not know yet. — Snoop
